Introduction
	CSS gives style to html pages

Basic Syntax
	Made up of various rules
		Selector and ; separated list of declarations. 
			Declarations made up property:value pair

<div> is an empty container; better to use other tags like <h1> for projects in general

Selectors
	HTML elements that CSS rules apply

Universal Selector
	Selects all elements.
		* {
		  color: purple;
		}

Type Selectors
	Selects all elements of a given type
		h1 {
		 color: white;
		}

Class Selectors
	All elements in a given class with a attribtute.
	<div class="alert">Blah blah blah </div>
	.alert {
		color: red;
	}
	Need period before class name, case sensitive
	Class names are space-separated, use '-' for multi-word class names

ID Selectors
	All elements with matching id attirbute
	<div id="title">Ha Ha</div>
	#title {
	background-color: red;
	}
	Use Ids spariningly, classes are often better
		Elements can only have 1 id, ids can't be repeated on the smae page

Grouping Selectors
	Use comma seperated list
	.read,
	.unread {
	declarations
	}

Chaining Selectors
	Selectors can be chained together, do not use a space
	.header.otherthing
	Can't chain more than one type selector
	
Descendant combinator
	Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining
	them, show relationship between the selectors.
	Single space between selectors => descendant combinator.
		Match elements if they have same ancestor
	No limit to num of combinators

Order Matters
	When 2 selectors have same level of precedence, rule defined last has the most precedence

Properties to get started with (will probably use all the time)
	color: Sets color of text
	background-color: sets background color of the element
		Both accept actual names (red or transparent), HEX, RGB, and HSL, values
	font-family: single value or ',' seperated list that detemine which font elements use
		2 kinds: "font family name" ("Times New Roman") or generic family name (sans-serif)
		If browser does not support a font, goes down list until it finds one
	font-size: size of font; font-size: 22px
	font-weight: boldness of font, takes key-words (font-weight: bold) or a number between 1-1000
	text-align: align text horizontally in element; use common key words in processors (i.e. center)
