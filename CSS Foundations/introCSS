Introduction
	CSS gives style to html pages

Basic Syntax
	Made up of various rules
		Selector and ; separated list of declarations. 
			Declarations made up property:value pair

<div> is an empty container; better to use other tags like <h1> for projects in general

Selectors
	HTML elements that CSS rules apply

Universal Selector
	Selects all elements.
		* {
		  color: purple;
		}

Type Selectors
	Selects all elements of a given type
		h1 {
		 color: white;
		}

Class Selectors
	All elements in a given class with a attribtute.
	<div class="alert">Blah blah blah </div>
	.alert {
		color: red;
	}
	Need period before class name, case sensitive
	Class names are space-separated, use '-' for multi-word class names

ID Selectors
	All elements with matching id attirbute
	<div id="title">Ha Ha</div>
	#title {
	background-color: red;
	}
	Use Ids spariningly, classes are often better
		Elements can only have 1 id, ids can't be repeated on the smae page

Grouping Selectors
	Use comma seperated list
	.read,
	.unread {
	declarations
	}

Chaining Selectors
	Selectors can be chained together, do not use a space
	.header#.otherthing
