The cascade determines which rules get applied to our HTML

A CSS declaration that is more specifc will take precedence over less specific ones.
	Inline styles have the highest specificty compared to selectors.
	Each type of selector has its own specificty level that contributes to how specific a declarationis.
	Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple conflicting declarations targeting it.
		Highest to lowest ID selector > Class selector > Type selector
Non-conflicting declarations still applied.

Inheritance
	CSS propeties that when applied to an element are inherited by element's descendant
		Rule does not need to be explicit for children
	Usualy typography
Rule order
	All else fails, last rule defined gets applied.
